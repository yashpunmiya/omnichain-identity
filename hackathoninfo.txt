We're extending the LayerZero Solana Breakout Bounty!

After reviewing the initial submissions, we've noticed a gap between the creative ideas presented and the core goal of this hackathon: to pioneer new applications using LayerZero V2 on Solana.

To give everyone a fair chance to meet this goal and to be more direct about our expectations, we are extending the competition window and clarifying the core requirement for prize eligibility.

To win, your submission must implement a LayerZero V2 Program on Solana.

Here is the updated hackathon listing:

LayerZero Solana Breakout Bounty
Announcement: The submission deadline has been extended! We are sharpening the focus of this bounty to challenge developers on what's possible with our latest technology. Prize winners will only be selected from teams that build their solution using LayerZero V2 Programs on Solana.

LayerZero is an immutable, censorship-resistant, and permissionless protocol that enables applications to send messages, assets, and data across blockchains. We are specifically looking for developers to build groundbreaking omnichain solutions that leverage the power and flexibility of our V2 contracts on Solana. Your challenge is to demonstrate a meaningful and innovative use of a LayerZero V2 Solana Program.

Judging Criteria - MANDATORY Requirement
Your project will be judged primarily on its implementation of a LayerZero V2 Program on Solana. To reiterate, projects that do not have use Solana or LayerZero V2 will be disqualified.

Core Requirement: Solana V2 Program Implementation

Does the project deploy and interact with a LayerZero V2 Omnichain Application (OApp) or Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) program on the Solana network? Submissions will be disqualified if they do not meet this fundamental requirement.

Technical Excellence & Code Quality:

Is the on-chain program well-structured, secure, and efficient?

Does the project effectively use the LayerZero V2 SDK for Solana?

Innovative Use Case:

Does your project solve a real cross-chain problem or create a novel user experience? Examples include cross-chain DeFi, multi-chain gaming, or new forms of omnichain identity and assets.

Working Demo:

You must provide a functional demo of your application. This can be a live website, a command-line interface, or a comprehensive video walkthrough. You must be able to demonstrate your Solana program interacting with the LayerZero V2 protocol.

How to Qualify
To qualify for the "Best Omnichain Solution" prizes, your submission must include the following:

A Deployed LayerZero V2 Program on Solana: Your project's core logic must reside in a Solana program that utilizes the LayerZero V2 OApp or OFT standards. A LayerZeroScan transaction hash can be used to prove your project has been deployed and works.

Publicly Verifiable Code: Your code must be available in a public GitHub repository. The repository must contain the Solana program code.

Completed Feedback Form: To help us improve our tools and documentation, submitting feedback is mandatory. The form is available below.

Developer Resources
Get started with our official documentation and examples. We strongly recommend you build directly from these resources.
